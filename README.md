## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Flutter Developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience** building production-ready mobile applications for real users and real businesses.  
I focus on **clean architecture, maintainable codebases, and smooth user experiences** that scale well over time.

---

## 🚀 My Journey

I began with UI-focused Flutter apps, but quickly realized that **architecture and structure** are what separate demos from real products.  
Over time, I developed a strong interest in clean architecture, state management, and backend-driven app flows.

Today, I approach Flutter development with a **product mindset**, not just a coding mindset.

---

## 💡 My Thoughts on Flutter & Dart

**Flutter**  
Flutter excels when consistency, structure, and design systems are taken seriously.  
I believe Flutter performs best when paired with **disciplined architecture and predictable state management**.

**Dart**  
Dart’s type safety, async model, and readability make it ideal for long-term, scalable applications.  
Clean Dart code is easy to refactor, debug, and maintain — which matters in production.
